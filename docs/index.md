# Welcome to MPCForces-Extractor

This is a simple tool for Optistruct Runs and can get the amount of Force which is transferred by a particular RBE Element:

## Functionality

* Detect RBE2 and RBE3 elements in your model
* Do a group segmentation for all connected (not by RBE2/RBE3) parts
* Ouput Sums of forces per RBE Element and therefore showing you how much force is being transfereed by which RBE Element

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to [Codie](https://github.com/codie3611), because without him my python skills would not be nearly as mediocre as they are ;)
* Thank you dear Wulu Tea for keeping me running at night
